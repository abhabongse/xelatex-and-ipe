# XeLaTeX and IPE

Template for XeLaTeX documents and IPE drawings.


## Features

- XeLaTeX document template for Latin and Thai scripts which works (almost) out of the box.  
  If you have full LaTeX ecosystems installed (like [`texlive-full`](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)) 
  then you are good to go.
- IPE drawing templates for rich-diagram drawings.
  This is optional and requires [`ipe`](http://ipe.otfried.org/) to be installed.
- List of pre-defined styles and commands (for both XeLaTeX documents and IPE drawings).
- `Makefile` for common build commands, etc.


## Usage

### XeLaTeX

Instead of relying on `build` commands in `Makefile`,
we recommend using a text editor or an IDE that supports LaTeX out of the box.
One of the best shots would be using `VSCode` with `LaTeX Workshop` extension installed.


### IPE

To be added.
